# How the Family Tree Works - Visual Guide

## Example Family Structure

When you add these family members and relationships:

### Family Members:
1. **John Smith** (Born: 1950) - Grandfather
2. **Mary Smith** (Born: 1952) - Grandmother
3. **Robert Smith** (Born: 1975) - Father
4. **Sarah Smith** (Born: 1978) - Mother
5. **Emily Smith** (Born: 2000) - Daughter
6. **Michael Smith** (Born: 2003) - Son

### Relationships to Add:
1. John + Mary = **Spouse**
2. John → Robert = **Parent-Child**
3. Robert + Sarah = **Spouse**
4. Robert → Emily = **Parent-Child**
5. Robert → Michael = **Parent-Child**
6. Emily ↔ Michael = **Sibling**

## The Tree Will Display Like This:

```
